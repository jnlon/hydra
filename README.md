# hydra
Hydra is a clone of a joke program within joke operating system that's really
just a [website](http://windows93.net)... Yeah.

"Hydra.exe" is a "virus" which opens a window that is impossible to close
because when you try to close it, it spawns another copy of itself. Quite
annoying. Ideally, the only way to kill the program is to reboot.

This project aims to recreate it in Qt and have it work on Windows/Unix. It's
still in early development, though.
